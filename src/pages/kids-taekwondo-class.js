                    		<p>This program is for ages 6-12 year olds. We have a built-in Bully defense system where they learn basic self-defense along with learning respect for one another and adults. At SMAC, we also encourage students with their school grades and check report cards and reward those who work hard and motivate those who donâ€™t do not excel. Values such as leadership, goal setting, confidence, discipline, integrity and respect are developed through positive reinforcement.</p>
